# We are LEAK Leeks!
-----
*About our class*
We are a team in the class ECE 3400: Intelligent Physical Systems at Cornell University. This class is designed to learn the fundamentals of Electrical and Computer Engineering through building an autonomous robot over the course of a semester. At the end of the semester, we have a final competition where our robots try to go through a maze as quickly as possible, avoid other robots, and collect treasures.
