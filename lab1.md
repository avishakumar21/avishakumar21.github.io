# Lab 1

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Goal:**
The goal of this lab was to understand how to program an Arduino to do different tasks so that eventually we would be able to program it to make the robot do an autonomous task.

**Materials:**
The main portion of this lab required the following materials for each subteam:
* Arduino Uno
* USB A/B Cable
* Continuous Rotation Servo
* LED
* Potentiometer
* Resistors
* 1 Solderless Breadboard
The preliminary construction of our robot required:
* Chassis
* Screws
* 9V Battery with Clip
* Ball Bearings

**Procedure:**
*Part 1: Blinking LED*
We first got the LED on the board to blink, then hooked up an external LED to the board as shown below. It is important to note that a series resistor of at least 300 ohm was added to this setup. Throughout this lab, series resistors were added to all components connected to pins to mediate the risk of burning out any of the components or pins.
