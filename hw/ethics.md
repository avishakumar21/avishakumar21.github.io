Our prompt: Is “a ban on offensive autonomous weapons beyond meaningful human control” going to work? 

Our stance: We will not be able to effectively ban offensive autonomous weapons given our history as a country and as a world that functions and profits off of warfare. For example, in the 1940’s, around the time of World War II, many scientists and civilians were against the development of nuclear weapons. However, due to the demand from the government, and our country’s concern for national security and preserving democracy, the United States, followed by eight other countries researched and developed nuclear weapons. Along those lines, we believe that offensive autonomous weapons will prove to be profitable for the government and help “improve” our warfare tactics. Once we obtain the knowledge to effectively implement and generate the weapons, we will not ban the use of the weapons.
